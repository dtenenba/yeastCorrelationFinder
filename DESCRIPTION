Title: Find common transcription factors in yeast expression data
Description: Allocco (2004) observes that "In S. cerevisiae, two genes
    have a 50% chance of having a common transcription factor binder if the
    correlation between their expression profiles is equal to 0.84."
    This package identifies such genes.
